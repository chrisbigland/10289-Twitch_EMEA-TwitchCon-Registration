## TODO


## NOTES
Twitch asked for the QR code image (that is created via the rainfocus code), be inserted into a <p> tag rather than inside of the src (as in showcase version). 

When the test comes through, ensure to test in testi to make sure this will work in a two column set up where we are unsure of the size of the image. I have wrapped the <p> tag in a 212px <div> to try and control its size, however, adjustments may need to be made for outlook.
